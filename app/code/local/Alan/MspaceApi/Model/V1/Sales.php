 *  logic for working with attributes right

 * @TODO - Remember a good api is about things not actions
 * ADD more things not actions. The below would be considered bad
 * design. You should instead have two classes (add two things) 
 * an AttributeOptions and AttributeData class and they should have
 * a single get, post, delete, etc 
 * @TODO - add stock inventory attributes to the output
